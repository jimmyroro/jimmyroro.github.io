          <p class="card-text">Upclose is a website my team and I developed from greenfield to deployment. It allows users to create a party and invite people to join it. Once inside a party, WebRTC and socket.io allow users to see and hear each other. There is a spatial aspect too, where audio diminishes as you get farther away from other usersâ€™ avatars.  I worked in the fronted and backend, using React hooks to build out the frontend and authenticated users with Google Login, saving the users and their parties to a remote MYSQL database. I learned how to integrate Typescript with React.js, and how to style with Tailwind instead of traditional CSS.</p>

It is a platform for creating movements that people can join and learn about, and was built with React.js, Node, Express, and MySQL. We added user stories to it, including messaging, linking charities, and creating events in a calendar.</p>
